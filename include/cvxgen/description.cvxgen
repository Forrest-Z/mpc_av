dimensions
  m = 2  # inputs.
  n = 2  # states.
  T = 50  # horizon.
end

parameters
  A (n,n)  # dynamics matrix, unity for now
  B  # transfer matrix, scalar = v*delT, v= velocity, delT = sample time
  Q (n,n) psd  # state cost, unity for now
  Q_final (n,n) psd  # final state cost, unity for now
  R (m,m) psd  # input cost, zero matrix for now
  x[0] (n)  # initial state.
  w (n) #waypoint vector
  u_max (m) nonnegative  # theta limit = [0.4189 ; 1]
end

variables
  x[t] (n), t=1..T+1  # state = [x ; y]
  u[t] (m), t=0..T  # input = [theta ; 1]
end

minimize
  sum[t=0..T](quad(x[t] - w, Q) + quad(u[t], R)) + quad(x[T+1]-w, Q_final)

subject to
  x[t+1] == A*x[t] + B*(u[t]), t=0..T  # dynamics constraints.
  abs(u[t]) <= u_max, t=0..T  # maximum input box constraint.
